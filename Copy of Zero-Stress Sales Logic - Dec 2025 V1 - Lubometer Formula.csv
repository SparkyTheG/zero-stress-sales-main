Step,Description,Logic / Notes
1,Raw Score (Per Indicator),1–10 for each of the 27 indicators
2,Average Per Pillar,Average the indicator scores within each pillar
3,Reverse Score: Price Sensitivity (P6),Reverse = 11 - Raw Score (e.g. 8 → 3)
4,Weighted Pillar Score,Multiply each pillar by its weight:
,,"P1 × 1.5, P2 × 1.0, P3 × 1.0, P4 × 1.5, P5 × 1.0, P6 × 1.0 (after reverse), P7 × 1.0"
5,Total Score Before Penalties,Sum of all 7 weighted pillar scores (max = 90)
6,Truth Index Penalties,Subtract penalty points for incoherence:
,High Pain + Low Urgency (≤4),–15
,High Desire + Low Decisiveness (≤4),–15
,High Money Access + High Price Sensitivity (≥8),–10
,Claims Authority + Reveals Need for Approval,–10
,High Desire + Low Responsibility (≤5),–15
7,Final Lubometer Score,Total Score – Penalties
8,Readiness Zone,70–90 → ✅ Green: High Buy Probability
,,"50–69 → ⚠️ Yellow: Moderate, needs coaching"
,,30–49 → 🧊 Red: Risk or resistance
,,<30 → ❌ No-Go: Do not close
9,Close Blocker Rule 1,P1 ≤ 6 AND P2 ≤ 5 → ❌ Not enough pain or urgency
10,Close Blocker Rule 2,P6 raw ≥ 7 AND P4 ≤ 5 → ❌ High price sensitivity + low money = don’t push
