ID,Pillar & Indicator,Example Objection,PEARL Prompt,David (Self-led Insight),Calvin (Pattern Interrupt),Carone (Direct Challenge)
1,Pain Awareness,“Things aren’t that bad right now.”,“What would have to change for this to feel urgent?”,“What are you comparing it to?”,“Sounds like you’ve adapted — is that working?”,"“So if things stay the same, you’re okay with that?”"
2,Desire Clarity,“I’m not even sure what I’d want instead.”,"“If it were perfect, what would it look like?”",“What would make this worth pursuing for you?”,“Let’s get clear on what you’d be solving.”,"“If you don’t know the target, how will you get there?”"
3,Desire Priority,“This is on the back burner for now.”,“What would move this to the front?”,“What makes this less important than other things?”,"“If you don’t prioritize this now, when will you?”",“That’s how people stay stuck — putting it off.”
4,Duration of Dissatisfaction,“I’ve lived with it for years.”,“What has it cost you over that time?”,"“If it hasn’t changed in years, why now?”",“So we’re breaking a decade-long pattern — let’s name that.”,“And you’re still okay with that?”
5,Time Pressure,“I’m not on a deadline.”,“What happens if you delay 3 more months?”,"“Without a trigger, what will make this real?”",“Let’s talk about the cost of waiting.”,“That’s exactly how people get stuck.”
6,Cost of Delay,“I’ll revisit this later.”,“What’s at stake if nothing changes?”,“What’s the price of inaction?”,“Later often means never — should we test that?”,“What’s going to magically make this easier later?”
7,Internal Timing Activation,“I’m not ready to decide.”,“What changed now that you’re even here?”,"“Why now, and not 6 months ago?”",“Something pulled you here — let’s honor that.”,"“If not now, when exactly?”"
8,Environmental Availability,“It’s a crazy time.”,“What would need to shift to make this doable now?”,“So are you saying now is actually impossible?”,“People make time for what matters — does this?”,“Is that real — or just an easy out?”
9,Decision-Making Authority,“I need to check with my partner.”,“Who else needs to feel good about this?”,“What would you need from them to move forward?”,“Let’s bring them in — or is that a stall?”,“You knew you’d need them — why not involve them now?”
10,Decision-Making Style,“I usually take time to reflect.”,“How do you usually make big decisions?”,“What’s your process been in the past?”,“Let’s make sure that style serves you now.”,“Or is that how you avoid deciding?”
11,Commitment to Decide,“Can I sleep on it?”,“What specifically are you going to think about?”,“What would you need to know to decide today?”,“Are you gathering clarity or deferring courage?”,“Let’s stop pretending — is it a no?”
12,Self-Permission to Choose,“What if I fail?”,“What permission do you need to move forward?”,“Are you waiting to feel 100% safe?”,“There’s no perfect moment — just choice.”,“So you’re giving your power away?”
13,Resource Access,“I don’t have the funds.”,"“If money were handled, would this be a yes?”","“If you had the cash, would this be solved?”",“Money’s a symptom — not the real issue.”,“So you’re letting money run your life?”
14,Resource Fluidity,“Our budget’s frozen.”,“What could be shifted to make space for this?”,“What options have you explored already?”,“Resourceful people find options. Want to try?”,“Excuse — or solvable constraint?”
15,Investment Mindset,“Not sure it’s worth it.”,“What’s the value if this works?”,“What are you comparing this to?”,“Let’s price the outcome — not the program.”,“Cheap thinking → cheap results.”
16,Resourcefulness,“I can’t make this work.”,“Have you ever figured out something you really wanted?”,“What did you do last time you wanted something badly?”,“This isn’t about cash — it’s about creativity.”,“So try. Or stay stuck.”
17,Problem Recognition,“It’s not really my fault.”,“What’s your role in this?”,"“If nothing changes, what are you responsible for?”",“No blame — just ownership.”,“If it’s always someone else… is that true?”
18,Solution Ownership,“Will this really work for me?”,“What part of the result will come from you?”,"“If this works, who made it work?”",“Systems help — you drive.”,“No one’s coming to save you.”
19,Locus of Control,"“If I get lucky, maybe.”",“Do you believe you create your outcomes?”,“How much of this is under your control?”,“Shift from hope to action.”,“Hope is not a strategy.”
20,Integrity: Desire vs Action,"“I want it, but…”",“What will you do differently this time?”,“We act from truth — not just want.”,“Wanting isn’t doing.”,“What’s different now?”
21,Emotional Response to Spending,“I’m anxious about spending this.”,“What would make this feel safe?”,“Is this emotion from price — or past patterns?”,“Fear = growth. Want in anyway?”,“Your future costs more.”
22,Negotiation Reflex,“Can you discount this?”,“Is the price or the result the real issue?”,“What’s the difference between discount and disservice?”,“Cheap = less commitment. You ready?”,“Why should you get less value?”
23,Structural Rigidity,“I want it my way.”,“What are you trying to protect against?”,“What’s driving the need for control?”,“Control kills results. Still want that?”,“Safety = stagnation.”
24,ROI Ownership Framing,"“This should pay for itself, right?”",“What will you do to make this worth it?”,“What ensures this works for you?”,"“ROI = action, not logic. Agree?”","“If you do nothing, ROI = $0.”"
25,External Trust,“I haven’t seen enough proof.”,“What proof would make you feel confident?”,“What would restore trust for you?”,"“Let’s rebuild proof, not excuses.”",“You’re looking for a reason not to believe.”
26,Internal Trust,“I’m not sure I can follow through.”,“What makes you doubt yourself?”,“Who would you be if you trusted yourself here?”,“Let’s rebuild you.”,“Trust is a decision.”
27,Risk Tolerance,“I don’t want to make a mistake.”,“What would feel safe enough to proceed?”,“What’s the worst-case — and can you handle it?”,“Risk = growth. Want to stay the same?”,“Safety = your current problem.”
